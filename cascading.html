                    <p id="definition"><span style="color:rgb(38, 156, 231)"><strong>Definition:</strong></span> 
                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of 
                        a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). 
                        CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.<br><br>

                        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers 
                        according to W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS 
                        specification was done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. 
                        You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.<br><br>
                        
                        From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress 
                        on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective 
                        to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning 
                        the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state 
                        of the CSS specification.<br><br>

                            <span style="color:rgb(38, 156, 231)"><strong>A Brief Hisory of CSS: </strong></span>
                            The saga of CSS starts in 1994. Håkon Wium Lie works at CERN - the cradle of the 
                            Web - and the Web is starting to be used as a platform for electronic publishing. 
                            One crucial part of a publishing platform is missing, however: There is no way to 
                            style documents. For example, there is no way to describe a newspaper-like layout 
                            in a Web page. Having worked on personalized newspaper presentations at the MIT 
                            Media Laboratory, Håkon saw the need for a style sheet language for the Web.

                            Style sheets in browsers were not an entirely new idea. The separation of document 
                            structure from the document's layout had been a goal of HTML from its inception in 
                            1990. Tim Berners-Lee wrote his NeXT browser/editor in such a way that he could 
                            determine the style with a simple style sheet. However, he didn't publish the syntax 
                            for the style sheets, considering it a matter for each browser to decide how to best 
                            display pages to its users. In 1992, Pei Wei developed a browser called Viola, which 
                            had its own style sheet language..<br><br>

                        <p class="paragraph-anatomy">The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document 
                            that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS 
                            to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the 
                            most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.<br><br>

                            Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as 
                            <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">styles.css.</span> 
                            The <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">.css </span>
                            extension shows that this is a CSS file.<br><br>

                            to <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">index.html</span>, 
                            add the following line somewhere inside the <head> of the HTML document:
                            <img  src="images/css-code-2.PNG" class="html-anatomy "><br><br>

                        </p>

                    <div class="main-parts-of-our-element">   
                        <p>This <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;link&gt;</span> 
                            element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the 
                            <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">rel</span> 
                            attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the
                            <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)"> href </span>
                            attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to 
                            <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">styles.css.</span> 
                            Using your code editor, add the following to your CSS file:</p> 
                    </div>

                        <img src="images/css-code-3.PNG" id="attribute-pic" class="attribute-pic">
                        <p class="paragraph-attribute">   
                            Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level 
                            one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, 
                            congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. 
                            If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.<br><br>

                            You can continue to work in<span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)"> styles.css </span>
                            locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the 
                            CSS in the first panel is linked to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.
                        </p>

                        <div id = "attribute-must-have" class="attribute-must-have">
                            <strong><p id="styling-html-elements"style=" text-align:center; color:rgb(38, 156, 231)" >STYLING HTML ELEMENTS</p></strong>
                                <P>
                                    By making our heading red, we have already demonstrated that we can target and 
                                    style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a 
                                    selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in 
                                    the document, you would use the selector 
                                    <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">p</span>. 
                                    To turn all paragraphs green, you would use:
                                </P>

                                You can target multiple selectors at the same time by separating the selectors 
                                with a comma. If you want all paragraphs and all list items to be green, your rule would look like this:
                            </P>
                            <img src="images/css-code-5.PNG" class="nesting-pic">

                                Try this out in the interactive editor below (edit the code boxes) or in your local CSS document.
                            </p>

                                When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, 
                                we can see how the browser is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. 
                                Headings are large and bold and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have 
                                internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to all pages by default; 
                                without them all of the text would run together in a clump and we would have to style everything 
                                from scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same way.<br><br>

                                However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. 
                                This can be done by choosing the HTML element that you want to change and using a 
                                CSS rule to change the way it looks. A good example is 
                                <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;ul&gt;</span>, 
                                an unordered list. It has list bullets. If you don't want those bullets, you can remove them like so:
                            </p><br>
                            
                        </div>

               
                        <div id="empty-elements" class="empty-elements">

                                The list-style-type property is a good property to look at on MDN to see which values are supported. Take a 
                                look at the page for list-style-type and you will find an interactive example at the top of the page to try 
                                some different values in, then all allowable values are detailed further down the page.<br><br>
                                Looking at that page you will discover that in addition to removing the list bullets, you can change them — try 
                                changing them to square bullets by using a value of square.

                            <P>
                                So far, we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of 
                                the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so 
                                you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others. The most common 
                                way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.<br><br>
                                In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like this:
                            </P>

                            <img src="images/css-code-8.PNG" class="anatomy-doc-pic"><br><br><br>
                            <p style="text-align:center">Source: &#9755 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"> MDN Web Docs</a></p>

                            <p>In your CSS, you can target the class of <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">special</span> 
                                by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS file:</p>    
                        </div>

                        <div id="image" class="image">
                            <img src="images/css-code-9.PNG" class="image-pic"><br><br><br>
                            <p>Save and refresh to see what the result is.</p>

                            <p>You can apply the class of <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">special</span> 
                                to any element on your page that you want to have the same look as this list item. For example, you might want the 
                                <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;span&gt;</span> in the paragraph to 
                                also be orange and bold. Try adding a <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">class</span> 
                                of <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">special</span> to it, then reload your page 
                                and see what happens.
                            </p><br><br>

                            <p>Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the class:</p>

                            <img src="images/css-code-10.PNG" class="test-image"><br><br><br>

                            <p>
                                This syntax means "target any <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">li</span> 
                                element that has a class of special". If you were to do this, then you would no longer be able to apply the class to 
                                a <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;span&gt;</span> or another element 
                                by adding the class to it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div id= "marking-up-text" class="marking-up-text">  
                            <img src="images/css-code-11.PNG" class="marking-pic"><br><br><br>
                            <p>
                                As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements 
                                and you don't want to have to keep editing your CSS every time 
                                something new needs to take on that style. Therefore, it is sometimes 
                                best to bypass the element and refer to the class, unless you know that 
                                you want to create some special rules for one element alone, and perhaps 
                                want to make sure they are not applied to other things.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div id="paragraph" class="paragraph">
                            <h5 id="styling-things" style="color:rgb(38, 156,231);text-align:center">STYLING THINGS BASED ON THEIR LOCATION IN A DOCUMENT</h5>

                            <P>There are times when you will want something to look different based on where it is in the document. 
                                There are a number of selectors that can help you here, but for now we will look at just a couple. 
                                In our document, there are two<span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)"> &lt;em&gt; </span>
                                elements — one inside a paragraph and the other inside a list item. To select only an 
                                <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;em&gt;</span> that is nested inside an 
                                <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;li&gt;</span> element, you can use a 
                                selector called the descendant combinator, which takes the form of a space between two other selectors.<br><br>
                                Add the following rule to your stylesheet:
                            </P>

                            <img src="images/css-code-12.PNG" class="paragraph-pic"><br><br><br>

                            <p>
                                This selector will select any <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;em&gt; </span>
                                element that is inside (a descendant of) an <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;li&gt;</span>. 
                                So in your example document, you should find that the <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;em&gt;</span>
                                in the third list item is now purple, but the one inside the paragraph is unchanged.<br><br>

                                Something else you might like to try is styling a paragraph when it comes directly after a heading at the same hierarchy 
                                level in the HTML. To do so, place a <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">+</span> 
                                (an adjacent sibling combinator) between the selectors.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div id = "list" class="list">
                            <p>Try adding this rule to your stylesheet as well:</p>

                            <img src="images/css-code-13.PNG" class="list-pic"><br><br><br>

                            <p>The live example below includes the two rules above. Try adding a rule to make a 
                                span red if it is inside a paragraph. You will know if you have it right because 
                                the span in the first paragraph will be red, but the one in the first list item will not change color.
                            </p>

                        <div id="links" class="links">
                            <h5 id="styling-based-on-state" style="color:rgb(38, 156,231);text-align:center">STYLING THINGS BASED ON STATE</h5>
                            <P>
                                The final type of styling we shall take a look at in this tutorial is the ability to style 
                                things based on their state. A straightforward example of this is when styling links. When 
                                we style a link, we need to target the <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;a&gt; </span>
                                (anchor) element. This has different states depending on whether it is unvisited, visited, 
                                being hovered over, focused via the keyboard, or in the process of being clicked (activated). 
                                You can use CSS to target these different states — the CSS below styles unvisited links pink and visited links green.
                            </P>
                                
                                <img src="images/css-code-16.PNG" class="links-pic3"><br><br><br>
                                
                                <p>
                                    You can change the way the link looks when the user hovers over it, for example 
                                    by removing the underline, which is achieved by the next rule:
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                In the live example below, you can play with different values for the 
                                various states of a link. I have added the rules above to it, and now 
                                realize that the pink color is quite light and hard to read — why not 
                                change that to a better color? Can you make the links bold?
                            </p>

                            <img src="images/css-code-18.PNG" class="level-one-heading-pic"><br><br><br>
                            <p>
                                We have removed the underline on our link on hover. You could remove 
                                the underline from all states of a link. It is worth remembering however 
                                that in a real site, you want to ensure that visitors know that a link is 
                                a link. Leaving the underline in place can be an important clue for people 
                                to realize that some text inside a paragraph can be clicked on — this is the
                                 behavior they are used to. As with everything in CSS, there is the potential
                                  to make the document less accessible with your changes — we will aim to 
                                  highlight potential pitfalls in appropriate places.
                            </p>

                            <P>It is worth noting that you can combine multiple selectors and combinators together. For example:</P>

                            <img src="images/css-code-20.PNG" class="level-one-heading-pic3"><br><br><br>

                            <p>You can combine multiple types together, too. Try adding the following into your code:</p>

                            <img src="images/css-code-21.PNG" class="level-one-heading-pic4"><br><br><br>

                            <p>
                                This will style any element with a class of special, which is inside a 
                                <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;p&gt;</span>, 
                                which comes just after an <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;h1&gt;</span>, 
                                which is inside a <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;body&gt;</span>. Phew!

                                In the original HTML we provided, the only element styled is 
                                <span style="background-color:rgb(71, 69, 69); color:rgb(38, 156, 231)">&lt;span class="special"&gt;</span>.
                                    
                                Don't worry if this seems complicated at the moment — you'll soon start to get the hang of it as you write more CSS.

                                of the lessons. However, you now already know enough to style text, apply CSS based 
                                on different ways of targeting elements in the document, and look up properties and 
                                values in the MDN documentation.<br><br><br>
